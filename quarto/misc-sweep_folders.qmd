# Introduction

This page shows code for taking UKDS zipped files, unzipping them and placing in per-sweep folders. For this code to work, you should download UKDS Stata files for a single study.

To begin you will need to create a folder, XX. Alternatively, this code can be downloaded by cloning the this GitHub repository, saving, opening the `.Rpoj` file

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# curr_dir <- getwd()
# setwd(Sys.getenv("mcs_fld"))
```

```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```

Why is this not working?

```{r}
df <- read_dta("3y/mcs2_cm_interview.dta")
df
```
