# Introduction

In this section, we show a few `R` functions for exploring BCS70 data; as noted, historical sweeps of the BCS70 did not use modern metadata standards, so finding a specific variable can be challenging. Variables do not always have names that are descriptive or follow a consistent naming convention across sweeps. (The variable for cohort member sex in the `0y/bcs7072a.dta` file is `a0255`, for example.) In what follows, we will use the `R` functions to find variables on cohort members' smoking, which has been collected in many of the sweeps.

The packages we will use are:

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Load Packages
library(tidyverse) # For data manipulation
library(haven) # For importing .dta files
library(labelled) # For searching imported datasets
library(codebookr) # For creating .docx codebooks
```

```{r}
#| include: false
# setwd(Sys.getenv("mcs_fld"))
```

# `labelled::lookfor()`

The `labelled` package contains functionality for attaching and examining metadata in dataframes (for instance, adding labels to variables [columns]). Beyond this, it also contains the `lookfor()` function, which replicates similar functionality in `Stata`. `lookfor()` also one to search for variables in a dataframe by keyword (regular expression); the function searches variable names as well as associated metadata. It returns an object containing matching variables, their labels, and their types, etc.. Below, we read in the BCS70 38-year sweep derived variable dataset (`38y/bcs8derived.dta`) and use `lookfor()` to search for variables which mention `"smok"` in their name or metadata.

```{r}
bcs70_38y <- read_dta("38y/bcs8derived.dta")

lookfor(bcs70_38y, "smok|cigar")
```

Users may consider it easier to create a tibble of the `lookfor()` output, which can be searched and filtered using `dplyr` functions. Below, we create a `tibble` (a type of `data.frame` with good printing defaults) of the `lookfor()` output and use `filter()` to find variables with `"smok"` or `"cigar"` in their labels. Note, we convert both the variable names and labels to lower case to make the search case insensitive.

```{r}
bcs70_38y_lookfor <- lookfor(bcs70_38y) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label))

bcs70_38y_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "smok|cigar"))
```


# `codebookr::codebook()`

The BCS70 datasets that are downloadable from the UK Data Service come bundled with data dictionaries within the `mrdoc` subfolder. However, these are limited in some ways. The `codebookr` package enables the creation of data dictionaries that are more customisable, and in our opinion, easier-to-read. Below we create a codebook for the BCS70 51-year sweep dataset. These codebooks are intended to be saved and viewed in Microsoft Word.


```{r}
cdb <- codebook(bcs70_38y)
print(cdb, "bcs70_38y_codebook.docx") # Saves as .docx (Word) file
```

A screenshot of the codebook is shown below.

# Create a Lookup Table Across All Datasets

Creating the `lookfor()` and `codebook()` one dataset at a time does not allow one to get a quick overview of the variables available in the BCS70, including the sweeps repeatedly measured characteristics are available in. Below we create a `tibble`, `df_lookfor`, that contains `lookfor()` results for all the `.dta` files in the BCS70 folder.

To do this, we create a function, `create_lookfor()`, that takes a file path to a `.dta` file, reads in the first row of the dataset (faster than reading the full dataset), and applies `lookfor()` to it. We call this function with a `mutate()` function call to create a set of lookups for every `.dta` file we can find in the BCS70 folder. `map()` loops over every value in the `file_path` column, creating a corresponding lookup table for that file, stored as a [`list-column`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling.html#list-columns). `unnest()` expands the results out, so rather than have one row per `file_path`, we have one row per variable.

```{r}
create_lookfor <- function(file_path){
  read_dta(file_path, n_max = 1) %>%
    lookfor() %>%
    as_tibble()
}

df_lookfor <- tibble(file_path = list.files(pattern = "\\.dta$", recursive = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(file_path, "^UKDS")) %>%
  mutate(lookfor = map(file_path, create_lookfor)) %>%
  unnest(lookfor) %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label)) %>%
  separate(file_path, 
           into = c("sweep", "file"), 
           sep = "/", 
           remove = FALSE) %>% 
  relocate(file_path, pos, .after = last_col())
```

We can use the resulting object to search for variables with `"smok"` or `"cigar"` in their labels.

```{r}
df_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "smok|cigar")) %>%
  select(file, variable, label)
```
