In this tutorial, we will learn how to combining MCS data across sweeps.
We will use data on cohort membersâ€™ heights which was recorded in Sweeps
2-7 and is available in the `mcs[2-7]_cm_interview.dta` files. These
files contain one row per cohort-member. As a reminder, we have
structured the data so that each sweep [has its own folder, which is
named according to the age of
follow-up](https://cls-data.github.io/docs/mcs-sweep_folders.html)
(e.g., 3y for the second sweep).

We will begin by combining data from the second and third sweeps. We
will show code to do this in wide (merging) and long (appending)
formats. We will then explore how to combine data from multiple sweeps
using the `dplyr` and `purrr` packages (from the `tidyverse`) to do this
in a programmatic way.

# 1. Straightforward merge (wide) ----
df_3y <- read_dta("3y/mcs2_cm_interview.dta") %>%
  select(MCSID, BCNUM00, BCHTCM00)

df_5y <- read_dta("5y/mcs3_cm_interview.dta") %>%
  select(MCSID, CCNUM00, CCHTCM00)


df_3y %>%
  full_join(df_5y, by = c("MCSID", BCNUM00 = "CCNUM00"))

df_3y %>%
  left_join(df_5y, by = c("MCSID", BCNUM00 = "CCNUM00"))

df_3y %>%
  inner_join(df_5y, by = c("MCSID", BCNUM00 = "CCNUM00"))


# 2. Append ----
df_3y_nopre <- df_3y %>%
  mutate(sweep = 2, .before = 1) %>%
  rename_with(~ str_replace(.x, "^B", ""))

df_5y_nopre <- df_5y %>%
  mutate(sweep = 3, .before = 1) %>%
  rename_with(~ str_replace(.x, "^C", ""))

bind_rows(df_3y_nopre, df_5y_nopre)

# 3. Doing it programatically ----
df_3y_rename <- df_3y %>%
  rename(cnum = BCNUM00)

  rename(cnum = CCNUM00)
