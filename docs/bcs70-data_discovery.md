# Introduction

In this section, we show a few `R` functions for exploring BCS70 data;
as noted, historical sweeps of the BCS70 did not use modern metadata
standards, so finding a specific variable can be challenging. Variables
do not always have names that are descriptive or follow a consistent
naming convention across sweeps. (The variable for cohort member sex in
the `0y/bcs7072a.dta` file is `a0255`, for example.) In what follows, we
will use the `R` functions to find variables on cohort members’ smoking,
which has been collected in many of the sweeps.

The packages we will use are:

```r
# Load Packages
library(tidyverse) # For data manipulation
library(haven) # For importing .dta files
library(labelled) # For searching imported datasets
library(codebookr) # For creating .docx codebooks
```

# `labelled::lookfor()`

The `labelled` package contains functionality for attaching and
examining metadata in dataframes (for instance, adding labels to
variables \[columns\]). Beyond this, it also contains the `lookfor()`
function, which replicates similar functionality in `Stata`. `lookfor()`
also one to search for variables in a dataframe by keyword (regular
expression); the function searches variable names as well as associated
metadata. It returns an object containing matching variables, their
labels, and their types, etc.. Below, we read in the BCS70 38-year sweep
derived variable dataset (`38y/bcs8derived.dta`) and use `lookfor()` to
search for variables which mention `"smok"` in their name or metadata.

```r
bcs70_38y <- read_dta("38y/bcs8derived.dta")

lookfor(bcs70_38y, "smok|cigar")
```

                                                    [1] Ex smoker             
                                                    [2] Occasional smoker     
                                                    [3] Up to 10 a day        
                                                    [4] 11 to 20 a day        
                                                    [5] More than 20 a day    
                                                    [6] Daily but frequency n~
```

Users may consider it easier to create a tibble of the `lookfor()`
output, which can be searched and filtered using `dplyr` functions.
Below, we create a `tibble` (a type of `data.frame` with good printing
defaults) of the `lookfor()` output and use `filter()` to find variables
with `"smok"` or `"cigar"` in their labels. Note, we convert both the
variable names and labels to lower case to make the search case
insensitive.

```r
bcs70_38y_lookfor <- lookfor(bcs70_38y) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label))

bcs70_38y_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "smok|cigar"))
```

# `codebookr::codebook()`

The BCS70 datasets that are downloadable from the UK Data Service come
bundled with data dictionaries within the `mrdoc` subfolder. However,
these are limited in some ways. The `codebookr` package enables the
creation of data dictionaries that are more customisable, and in our
opinion, easier-to-read. Below we create a codebook for the BCS70
51-year sweep dataset. These codebooks are intended to be saved and
viewed in Microsoft Word.

```r
cdb <- codebook(bcs70_38y)
print(cdb, "bcs70_38y_codebook.docx") # Saves as .docx (Word) file
```

A screenshot of the codebook is shown below.

# Create a Lookup Table Across All Datasets

Creating the `lookfor()` and `codebook()` one dataset at a time does not
allow one to get a quick overview of the variables available in the
BCS70, including the sweeps repeatedly measured characteristics are
available in. Below we create a `tibble`, `df_lookfor`, that contains
`lookfor()` results for all the `.dta` files in the BCS70 folder.

To do this, we create a function, `create_lookfor()`, that takes a file
path to a `.dta` file, reads in the first row of the dataset (faster
than reading the full dataset), and applies `lookfor()` to it. We call
this function with a `mutate()` function call to create a set of lookups
for every `.dta` file we can find in the BCS70 folder. `map()` loops
over every value in the `file_path` column, creating a corresponding
lookup table for that file, stored as a
[`list-column`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling.html#list-columns).
`unnest()` expands the results out, so rather than have one row per
`file_path`, we have one row per variable.

```r
create_lookfor <- function(file_path){
  read_dta(file_path, n_max = 1) %>%
    lookfor() %>%
    as_tibble()
}

df_lookfor <- tibble(file_path = list.files(pattern = "\\.dta$", recursive = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(file_path, "^UKDS")) %>%
  mutate(lookfor = map(file_path, create_lookfor)) %>%
  unnest(lookfor) %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label)) %>%
  separate(file_path, 
           into = c("sweep", "file"), 
           sep = "/", 
           remove = FALSE) %>% 
  relocate(file_path, pos, .after = last_col())
```

``` text
Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 3174 rows [28943, 28944,

28956, 28957, 28958, 28959, 28960, 28961, 28962, ...].
```

We can use the resulting object to search for variables with `"smok"` or
`"cigar"` in their labels.

```r
df_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "smok|cigar")) %>%
  select(file, variable, label)
```
