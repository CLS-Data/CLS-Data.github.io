# Introduction

In this section, we show a few `R` functions for exploring NCDS data; as
noted, historical sweeps of the NCDS did not use modern metadata
standards, so finding a specific variable can be challenging. Variables
do not always have names that are descriptive or follow a consistent
naming convention across sweeps. (The variable for cohort member sex is
`N622`, for example.) In what follows, we will use the `R` functions to
find variables for cohort members’ height, which has been collected in
many of the sweeps.

The packages we will use are:

```r
# Load Packages
library(tidyverse) # For data manipulation
library(haven) # For importing .dta files
library(labelled) # For searching imported datasets
library(codebookr) # For creating .docx codebooks
```

# `labelled::lookfor()`

The `labelled` package contains functionality for attaching and
examining metadata in dataframes (for instance, adding labels to
variables \[columns\]). Beyond this, it also contains the `lookfor()`
function, which replicates similar functionality in `Stata`. `lookfor()`
also one to search for variables in a dataframe by keyword (regular
expression); the function searches variable names as well as associated
metadata. It returns an object containing matching variables, their
labels, and their types, etc.. Below, we read in the NCDS 55-year sweep
dataset which contains derived variables (`55y/ncds_2013_derived.dta`)
and use `lookfor()` to search for variables related to `"height"`.

```r
ncds_55y <- read_dta("55y/ncds_2013_derived.dta")

lookfor(ncds_55y, "height")
```

``` text
 pos variable label                      col_type missing values             
 46  ND9HGHTM (Derived) Height in metres dbl+lbl  0       [-8] No information
```

Users may consider it easier to create a tibble of the `lookfor()`
output, which can be searched and filtered using `dplyr` functions.
Below, we create a `tibble` (a type of `data.frame` with good printing
defaults) of the `lookfor()` output and use `filter()` to find variables
with `"height"` in their labels. Note, we convert both the variable
names and labels to lower case to make the search case insensitive.

```r
ncds_55y_lookfor <- lookfor(ncds_55y) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label))

ncds_55y_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "height"))
```

``` text
# A tibble: 1 × 9

  <int> <chr>    <chr>         <chr>      <int> <name> <named list> <chr>

# ℹ 1 more variable: label_low <chr>
```

# `codebookr::codebook()`

The NCDS datasets that are downloadable from the UK Data Service come
bundled with data dictionaries within the `mrdoc` subfolder. However,
these are limited in some ways. The `codebookr` package enables the
creation of data dictionaries that are more customisable, and in our
opinion, easy to read. Below we create a codebook for the NCDS 55-year
sweep derived variable dataset. These codebooks are intended to be saved
and viewed in Microsoft Word.

```r
cdb <- codebook(ncds_55y)
print(cdb, "ncds_55y_codebook.docx") # Saves as .docx (Word) file
```

A screenshot of the codebook is shown below.

# Create a Lookup Table Across All Datasets

Creating the `lookfor()` and `codebook()` one dataset at a time does not
allow one to get a quick overview of the variables available in the
NCDS, including the sweeps repeatedly measured characteristics are
available in. Below we create a `tibble`, `df_lookfor`, that contains
`lookfor()` results for all the `.dta` files in the NCDS folder.

To do this, we create a function, `create_lookfor()`, that takes a file
path to a `.dta` file, reads in the first row of the dataset (faster
than reading the full dataset), and applies `lookfor()` to it. We call
this function with a `mutate()` function call to create a set of lookups
for every `.dta` file we can find in the NCDS folder. `map()` loops over
every value in the `file_path` column, creating a corresponding lookup
table for that file, stored as a
[`list-column`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling.html#list-columns).
`unnest()` expands the results out, so rather than have one row per
`file_path`, we have one row per variable.

```r
create_lookfor <- function(file_path){
  read_dta(file_path, n_max = 1) %>%
    lookfor() %>%
    as_tibble()
}

df_lookfor <- tibble(file_path = list.files(pattern = "\\.dta$", recursive = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(file_path, "^UKDS")) %>%
  mutate(lookfor = map(file_path, create_lookfor)) %>%
  unnest(lookfor) %>%
  mutate(variable_low = str_to_lower(variable),
         label_low = str_to_lower(label)) %>%
  separate(file_path, 
           into = c("sweep", "file"), 
           sep = "/", 
           remove = FALSE) %>% 
  relocate(file_path, pos, .after = last_col())
```

We can use the resulting object to search for variables with `"height"`
in their labels.

```r
df_lookfor %>%
  filter(str_detect(label_low, "height")) %>%
  select(file, variable, label)
```
