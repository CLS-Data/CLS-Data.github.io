# Introduction

Once you have downloaded MCS data from the UK Data Service, you will notice that the data from a given sweep is split across multiple files (e.g., as in the below screenshot). The reason for this is that the MCS contains information on different observational units, for instance on the cohort members, the cohort members' parents, and the cohort members' families. The data is split across different files so that it can be stored efficiently. For instance, variables on the cohort members themselves are stored in files with one row per cohort member, while variables on parents are stored in files with one row per parent. The aim of this tutorial is to give you an overview of the data structures used by the MCS.

# Naming Conventions

The MCS data files use a consistent naming convention. Files are prefixed `mcs[1-7]`, with `[1-7]` referring to a survey sweep (`mcs1`, `mcs2`, ..., `mcs7`). Next, the file name gives information on the 'focus' of the information it contains. Below are the main file names, though individual sweeps may have some additional files. The star (`*`) in these file paths is used as a wildcard. We give a brief overview here, but explain the structures in more detail below, including discussing the variables required to identify observational units.

-   `mcs[1-7]_family_*.dta`
    -   Contains family-level information (one row per family).
-   `mcs[1-7]_cm_*.dta`
    -   Contains cohort member-level information (one row per cohort member). Some families have more than one cohort member (e.g., in cases of twins).
-   `mcs[1-7]_parent_*.dta`
    -   Contains parent-level (or, more accurately, caregiver-level) information (one row per parent). Most families have two parents, but the number and identity of these parents can change between sweeps (e.g., in cases of divorce and remarrying).
-   `mcs[1-7]_parent_cm_interview.dta`
    -   Contains cohort member-level information reported by individual parents (one row per cohort member x parent combination). A cohort member can be represented in two rows.
-   `mcs[1-7]_hhgrid.dta`
    -   Contains information on the household grid (one row per member of the household).

`mcs[1-7]_family_*.dta`, `mcs[1-7]_cm_*.dta`, and `mcs[1-7]_parent_*.dta` are typically split across two files each, one for raw responses and one for derived variables (e.g., `mcs1_cm_interview.dta` and `mcs1_cm_derived.dta`). Note, `mcs1_*_interview.dta` does not mean the data was obtained via interview of the focal person themselves; for instance, a lot of the information in the `mcs[1-7]_cm_interview.dta` files is from parents.

# `mcs[1-7]_family_*.dta`

Below is a schematic of the family-level files. There is one row per family and the family is uniquely identified by the variable `MCSID`. `MCSID` is a string variable that follows a standard but uninformative convention. The name of the variable is the same wherever it appears (i.e., it does not differ between sweeps). Below we show just three `MCSIDs`, which we'll also use in the schematics for other data structures.

| `MCSID` | ... |
|---------|-----|
| M10001A | ... |
| M10007B | ... |
| M10005C | ... |
| ...     | ... |

# `mcs[1-7]_cm_*.dta`

The cohort member-level files have one row per cohort member. Cohort members are identified with two variables, `MCSID`, the family ID, and `[A-G]CNUM00`, the ID of the cohort member within the family. The variable name for `[A-G]CNUM00` differs between sweep, with the first letter referring to the sweep (`ACNUM00` for the first sweep, `BCNUM00` for the second sweep, ..., `GCNUM00` for the seventh sweep).[^1] While the variable name changes across sweeps, its value is persistent - a cohort member will have the same `[A-G]CNUM00` value over time.

[^1]: The same letter prefix is also used for other variables from the same sweep, and (by and large) names for the same variable differ only by this letter between sweeps. (An exception is that names in Sweep 5, though beginning `E`, differ from other sweeps.) For instance, in Sweeps 1-4, the name of the variable containing cohort members' height are `ACHTM00` , `BCHTM00`, `CCHTM00` and `DCHTM00`, respectively.

| `MCSID` | `[A-G]CNUM00`                       | ... |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| M10001A | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10001A | 2 (2nd Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10007B | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10005C | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| ...     | ...                                 | ... |

On its own, `[A-G]CNUM00` is not a unique identifier. Its value is 1, 2, or 3 for every cohort member. A singleton will be 1, a twin could be 1 or 2, and a triplet 1, 2, or 3.[^2] Both `MCSID` and `[A-G]CNUM00` are required to uniquely identify a cohort member.

[^2]: Data from triplets is not available in the standard UKDS End User Licence datasets.

Because two variables are required to uniquely identify a cohort member (one of which is not consistently named across files), you may prefer to create your own single, unique identifier variable to make merging more straightforward. This can be achieved by concatenating `MCSID` and `[A-G]CNUM00` variables (e.g., using the `glue` package \[part of the `tidyverse`\] in `R`; `glue("{MCSID}_{[A-G]CNUM00}")`).

# `mcs[1-7]_parent_*.dta`

The parent files have a similar structure to the cohort member-level (`mcs[1-7]_cm_*.dta`) files: one row per parent. Individual parents are identified with two variables, `MCSID` and `[A-G]PNUM00`. `[A-G]PNUM00` is the ID of the person within the family. Below we have records for two parents in the `M10001A` family. The first parent is number one, the second parent is number three.

| `MCSID` | `[A-G]PNUM00` | ... |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| M10001A | 1             | ... |
| M10001A | 3             | ... |
| M10007B | 1             | ... |
| M10007B | 2             | ... |
| M10005C | 1             | ... |
| ...     | ...           | ... |

Like `[A-G]CNUM00`, `[A-G]PNUM00` on its own is not a unique identifier. It lists the person number within the family, so it has to be combined with `MCSID` to identify a particular individual. Again, like `[A-G]CNUM00`, `[A-G]PNUM00` has a sweep-specific prefix, but takes the same value across sweeps for a given individual (i.e., it is persistent).

The value of `[A-G]PNUM00` is partly arbitrary. It does not specify a particular relationship to a cohort member. Such relationships are determined in the household grid files, which we discuss further below. The `[A-G]PNUM00` does follow a convention, however. For non-cohort members, `[A-G]PNUM00` is a positive integer between 1 and 99. For cohort members, `[A-G]PNUM00` is equal to `[A-G]CNUM00` multiplied by 100; i.e. for the first cohort member in a family it is 100, and for the second it is 200.[^3] While cohort members have a `[A-G]PNUM00`, non-cohort members (parents or other household members) do not get a `[A-G]CNUM00`.

[^3]: Exceptions to this are `mcs[6-7]_hhgrid.dta` where for all cohort members `[F-G]PNUM00 == -1 [Not applicable]`.

Again, as two variables are required to uniquely identify a parent, you may prefer to create a single, unique identifier variable by concatenating `MCSID` and `[A-G]PNUM00`.

The `mcs[1-7]_parent_*.dta` files do not contain information only on (biological) parents. As people may enter and exit a cohort member's household over time, the same individuals may not be interviewed each sweep. The [study user guides](https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-Series-2000031) can be consulted for further information on eligibility for the parent interview.

Note, Sweeps 2 and 3 also contain a `mcs[2-3]_older_siblings_questionnaire.dta` file. These files are structured similarly to `mcs[1-7]_parent_*.dta` - there is one row per sibling. Siblings are identified with `MCSID` and `BHPNUM00` or `MCSID` and `COPNUM00`.

# `mcs[1-7]_parent_cm_interview.dta`

The `mcs[1-7]_parent_cm_interview.dta` files record information from individual parents about individual cohort members, typically on the relationship between the two. For instance, in the first sweep, the file contains (among other data) information reported by each parent on whether they have ever lived apart from a particular cohort member.

As the MCS contains some twin and triplet families, each parent may report on multiple cohort members. As each parent may be interviewed, each child could be reported on by multiple parents. Below for the family `M1001A`, we have two parents (`[A-G]PNUM00` 1 and 3) who each report on two children (`[A-G]CNUM00` 1 and 2). Therefore, we have four rows for this family, one per parent x cohort member combination. For the other families, we have fewer rows, either because the family only contains one cohort member (as for the family `M1007B`) or the interview was only completed by one parent (as for the family `M1005C`).

| `MCSID` | `[A-G]PNUM00` | `[A-G]CNUM00`                       | `[A-G]ELIG00`         | ... |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| M10001A | 1             | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | 1 (Main Interview)    | ... |
| M10001A | 3             | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | 2 (Partner Interview) | ... |
| M10001A | 1             | 2 (2nd Cohort Member of the Family) | 1 (Main Interview)    | ... |
| M10001A | 3             | 2 (2nd Cohort Member of the Family) | 2 (Partner Interview) | ... |
| M10007B | 1             | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | 1 (Main Interview)    | ... |
| M10007B | 2             | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | 2 (Partner Interview) | ... |
| M10005C | 1             | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | 1 (Main Interview)    | ... |
| ...     | ...           | ...                                 | ...                   | ... |

A helpful variable when using the `mcs[1-7]_parent_cm_interview.dta` file is `[A-G]ELIG00`. This records the type of interview the parent completed - either "`1 [Main Interview]`" or "`2 [Partner Interview]`". The main interview (completed by the cohort members' main caregiver) is longer than the partner interview. Accordingly, some variables in `mcs[1-7]_parent_cm_interview.dta` may only be reported by one parent. For instance, in Wave 1, birth weight was recorded from main interviews only.

Different people may answer the main or partner interviews over time - a parent may answer the main interview in one sweep and the partner interview in another, or a caregiver may leave the household and be replaced by another person. Therefore, while `[A-G]ELIG00` can be used to merge data across sweeps (e.g., merge main parent interviews together), it is not a persistent identifier of a specific individual. `[A-G]PNUM00` can be retained in this case so that individual respondents can still be identified post-merge.

Note, `[A-G]ELIG00` also appears in the `mcs[1-7]_parent_interview.dta` files as the main parent interview also elicited additional information on the parent themselves.

# `mcs[1-7]_hhgrid.dta`

The `mcs[1-7]_hhgrid.dta` files contain rosters of household members. There is a row for each individual (cohort member or not), regardless of whether they were eligible for, or participated in, an interview. Individuals are identified either with `MCSID` and `[A-G]CNUM00` (cohort members) or `MCSID` and `[A-G]PNUM00` (all individuals).

| `MCSID` | `[A-G]PNUM00` | `[A-G]CNUM00`                       | ... |
|---------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| M10001A | 1             | .                                   | ... |
| M10001A | 3             | .                                   | ... |
| M10001A | 4             | .                                   | ... |
| M10001A | 100           | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10001A | 200           | 2 (2nd Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10007B | 1             | .                                   | ... |
| M10007B | 2             | .                                   | ... |
| M10007B | 100           | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| M10005C | 1             | .                                   | ... |
| M10005C | 100           | 1 (1st Cohort Member of the Family) | ... |
| ...     | ...           | ...                                 | ... |

The household grid files also contain a variable, `[A-G]HCREL00`, which contains the relationship of the person (ego) to the cohort member (alter) in their family (i.e., whether they are a natural parent and so on). Further, there are variables that define relationships between non-cohort members (`[A-D]HPREL[A-Z]0` in `mcs[1-4]_hhgrid.dta`, `EPREL0[A-Z]00` in `mcs5_hhgrid.dta`, and `[F-G]HPREL0[A-Z]` in `mcs[6-7]_hhgrid.dta`). The letter `[A-Z]` in the variable name maps directly to a `[A-F]PNUM00`: `[A-D]HPRELA0` contains information on a person's relationship to the person with `[A-D]PNUM00 == 1`, `[A-D]HPRELB0` contains information on the relationship with `[A-D]PNUM00 == 2`, and so on. Given its complexity, the household grid files are described further in [*Working with the Household Grid*](https://cls-data.github.io/docs/mcs-household_grid.html).
